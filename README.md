###### How does this work?

Native javascript testing is achieved through Jest + Puppeteer + Sauce Labs.  You get the power and expressiveness of Jest, the control of Puppeteer, and the integrated test platform of Sauce Labs.

* To learn more about Jest, visit https://jestjs.io/
* To learn more about the Google project Puppeteer, visit https://developers.google.com/web/tools/puppeteer

###### What is in this example?

The examples here show how Pipeline testing can be used.  Give it a try and find your own use cases.

* Included are instructions for setting up CI/CD using either GitHub Actions or CircleCI Workflows.  This mechanism works with any CI/CD provider that supports containers.
* Set of example browser tests that demonstrate how you could use Pipeline Testing for browser validation
* Mechanism to populate Sauce Labs and leverage the reporting, failure analysis and other tools of a unified test platform
