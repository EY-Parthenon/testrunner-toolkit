# Contributing

The Sauce Labs saucectl repo is an open source project.  We are excited to engage with you and the community. 
 Contribution can come in many forms like writing examples, making suggestions, pointing out bugs, or updating
 documents.  Most important is your patience and engagement.  We are starting a significant journey in the open 
 instead of behind closed doors.  Join us to make something great.
 
# Reporting Bugs
Please start by validating that the bug occurs in a simplified environment.  If it does, please search the master 
 branch and the release branch where you saw the problem.  It could be that we've seen the bug before and are already
 hard at work on it.
 [master branch](https://github.com/saucelabs/saucectl/issues) - start here on GitHub.

We are a community of testers.  Let's not be the cobblers kids. Please be clear, specific, and add working examples
 of the problems you are seeing.  The problem will be resolved a lot faster if you do.

# Features
We have a lot of ideas and I'm sure you do too.  Please use our [issues list](https://github.com/mozilla/MozDef/issues)
 to suggest new features that you would like to see added.  Once again, detail wins.  Be clear and outcome oriented in
 your requests - it just makes it easier for us to evaluate and prioritize.

# Process

If you have a fix or a feature to add, please make sure it is attached to a prior (or new) issue in the issues list.  
 We will likely reach out to you to ask questions and discuss approaches.  Please understand this is about ensuring
 that the repo stays easy for everyone to use.
